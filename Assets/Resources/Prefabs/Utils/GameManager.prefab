  tutorialText: "Why Don't They Fix The D@&n Roads!?\n\nWelcome to {playthroughStatistics.cityName}.\nYou
    are a city beurocrat whose job is to use a yearly budget to \nfix roads and potholes
    that show up every month. Potholes and \nconstruction are annoying, but some
    potholes can be really \nannoying, like ones on busy or poor quality roads, so
    be sure to \nfind the ones that cause the most anger. There are also limits to
    \nhow much construction you can do in a single month, so plan \nahead. Spending
    more on roads and potholes gives you higher \nquality materials, which means
    longer lasting repairs. You win if \nyou can last 5 years without an uprising
    or cash out with leftover \nfunds and retire to your favorite sandy beachfront
    location\r."
